## Jenstation 13
Jenstation is not supposed to be a proper Space Station 13 server. It's just a place for people to mess around in a Medium RP setting and experiment, and a place for me to mess around with the technical side of SS13 like DM, spriting and mapping, as well as the roleplay side as well. I don't yet know how I'm gonna host the server, but I will at some point (hopefully.) Feel free to do whatever you like with the source code for this.
I'm also only using Paracode because I'm an avid Paradise player.

## Licence
Just like Paradise, Jenstation uses the AGPL v3 licence, meaning you can modify the code however you like as long as you provide the source code as open source. Also, there's something about the files in the goonstation/ subdirectory, but I forgot what those were, so just check out Paradise's README.
